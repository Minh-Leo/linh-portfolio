                This is the start of my new journey with SPARK Deakin!
                <br />
                I started to learn and do research about entrepreneurship since
                I was in high school, but it was rather an alone journey.
                Whenever an idea comes into my mind (which is a lot of times,
                sometimes in the same day), I would write it down and save it
                there. Till this point, I currently have a huge collection of
                ideas, yet never had an opportunity to initiate or execute them.
                <br />
                <br />
                Coming to the SPARK Deakin Ideation Program with a beginner’s
                mind, I hope to learn new things and step-by-step techniques to
                bring any good ideas into life. <br />
                Other than that, I hope to build a network of like-minded pals
                who have the same interests and energy to create new products or
                services that make an impact. I made this blog series to record
                my learning journey throughout the program, and am excited to
                see how much I grow afterwards.

                An introduction of me, <br />
                I am currently a third-year Marketing student at Deakin
                University, who is always willing to talk new ideas and do
                anything creative. During my time in university and work as a
                freelancer, I have developed a passion for a wide range of
                interests: digital marketing & advertising, visual content &
                storytelling, market research and business development using
                technology. I always found myself drawn to creativity, both in
                problem-solving and visual production. The ability to think
                outside of the box and adapt to innovation are the two things I
                value most. To be able to use that and help businesses (or the
                community) propers in their own ways is a beautiful journey that
                I want to be a part of. <br />
                In the meantime, you can find me playing on my piano, or writing
                about my travels (on the road and in the mind) at <br />

                I am also thrilled to see that one of the ideas I had in the
                shower some time last year :”) has come into life. In 2021, I
                can start going to Woolworths for groceries without feeling
                guilty that something I buy will be the reason to destroy our
                living environment. This is a brilliant idea and I’m glad that
                Australian retailers are aware of the responsibility to protect
                the environment and are taking step-by-step to reach that
                zero-waste goal. <br />

                24 July 2020 <br /><br />
                This week at SPARK, we talked about how to use Design Thinking
                to strengthen our business ideas. By making the problem tree and
                filling in a value proposition canvas model, I gained some
                insights about how to take the next first steps following the
                write-down-my-ideas-into-a-notebook step. In the workshop, Issac
                introduced us to the 4 D’s of Design Thinking which are
                Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver.
              </p>
              <p>
                ● Discover: the process of looking at a problem from different
                angles, in order to gain an insight and understanding of a
                problem. <br />
                ● Define: the process of narrowing down to the specific problem
                we want to solve (address one sub-category in a big
                picture/issue)
                <br />
                ● Develop: the process of looking at all possible solutions,
                without any boundaries <br />
                ● Deliver: the process of creating cheap, tangible, testable
                versions of solutions and asking for customers' point-of-views
                => market research for product improvement
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                (visit Issac’s blog at
                <a href="https://isaacjeffries.com/"
                  >https://isaacjeffries.com/</a
                >
                ) <br />
                It is definitely easier to break down an idea into smaller
                categories. I am still on my way to look into different problems
                and do some extensive research. However, recycling and reducing
                single-used waste has always been there in the back of my mind.
                That was the reason I decided to design a problem statement
                using the problem tree surrounding the ‘throwaway culture’ -
                retail products single-used packaging issue. This tree consists
                of 3 parts: problem (the trunk of the tree), cause (the root of
                the tree), and causes (the branch of the tree).

              <p>
                As we all know, food packaging provides a way to make food safe,
                reliable, clean and also a way for brands to conduct marketing
                strategies for their products. Unfortunately, most food
                packaging is designed to be used only once and only some can be
                recycled. Everytime we make that grocery trip to any retails and
                pick up some food, there is a huge possibility that we will buy
                something that is contained in a single-used package. I made a
                little experiment myself by taking a photo of all containers I
                had used once and thrown away and the result is more than
                horrifying. In a week, I had thrown away a total of 20
                containers (in the form of boxes, cannes, plastics, glass,
                metal, paperboard, etc.) I, then, realized that if a hundred, a
                thousand, or hundred of thousand of people who did the same
                thing, the amount of waste every year (only from food packaging)
                is massive.
              </p>
              <p>
                The negative impacts (the branches) of this ‘throwaway culture’
                on the environment is countless. I only listed a few highlights
                here, and mostly are the damage to the ecosystem and natural
                resources. The causes of the issues (the roots) could be the
                lack of retail policy, or the ‘profits-focused’ issue, or that
                consumer mindset does take a long time to build habit. If we
                look at the plastic-bag ban, it did take quite a while to plan
                and execute.
                <br /><br />
                There are already many zero-waste businesses out there who allow
                customers to bring their re-use containers to refill the
                products. However, those types of businesses are not widespread
                and retails like Coles, Woolworth, Aldi, etc. are still the main
                outlet to grocery shopping
              </p>
              <p>
                By building this problem tree and digging deeper into the issue
                for the past week, I have learned a lot and on my way to form
                solid knowledge and figure out an up-to-date reliable
                information source. <br />
                <br />
                I am more than excited to know that Woolworth, partner with
                TerraCycle, is launching a revolutionary ‘Loop’ platform in 2021
                in Australian to tackle plastic waste. This platform allows
                Australian grocery shoppers to create a circular shopping system
                where finished product packages can be collected, cleaned,
                refilled and reused. Not only applied to food products, they
                also apply to other household products like detergent, shampoo,
                brand-specific products. <br /><br />
                In 2021, I can start going to Woolworths for groceries without
                feeling guilty that something I buy will be the reason to
                destroy our living environment. This is a brilliant idea and I’m
                glad that Australian retailers are aware of the responsibility
                to protect the environment and are taking step-by-step to reach
                that zero-waste goal.

                This week at SPARK, we revised about Problem Tree and Value
                Proposition as well as learned how to develop and generate ideas
                through “The Three Lenses” model and Lean Startup Principles.
                <br /><br />
                In the workshop, Isaac talked about how innovations can only be
                successful if three conditions (the three lenses) are met:
                ​desirability​ (someone wants it), ​feasibility​ (we can deliver
                it), and ​viability (it makes economic sense). In order to
                evaluate whether they meet or potentially meet the conditions,
                we need to run our product through tests and use measurement to
                record performance.

                As we discussed, I remember when I was in secondary school and
                had to make cupcakes for a bake sale at school. With my
                imagination, I did not want to make the same cupcakes as anybody
                else, so I came up with the ideas of making cupcakes with dark
                colour themes (black) and using local ingredients for new
                flavour instead of making bright colourful cupcakes with normal
                fruits. I was really proud of my idea and wanted to jump into
                baking right away. When I told my dad about it, he told me that
                he supported my ideas, however, he introduced me to the ‘demand
                and supply’ aspects and got me thinking about it. After that,
                although I, as a kid, wanted to keep my idea a secret until the
                bake sale, I talked with many of my friends about the idea and
                asked for their opinion. When they all seemed to be interested
                in that and would love to try new flavours, I decided to make
                the product and the sale was surprisingly successful.<br /><br />
                As I remember the story, I realize that the simple principle as
                the three lense can make a big impact in the entrepreneurial
                process. In the story, the orders are Feasibility (I can make
                new kind of cupcakes), Viability (cheap local ingredients, bake
                sale as free venue), and Desirability (ask if my friends want
                it).<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                In the workshop, Isaac also suggested 2 books which are ​The
                Lean Startup​ by Eric Ries and ​The Mom Test​ by Rob
                Fitzpatrick. One of the quotes I really like and take away from
                the workshop is:<br /><br />

                "We must learn what customers really want,<br />
                not what they say they want or what we think they should
                want."<br /><br />
                Imagine if my friends told me they really like to try the new
                cupcakes but turns out they just said that to encourage me with
                the new ideas but didn’t really want to buy it, it would be a
                disaster. Well, I guess real life is not the same as secondary
                school, of course. However, that’s why there is a Feedback Loop:
                Build - Measure - Learn (Eric). This Loop perspective will help
                us continuously conduct different ideas and products until it is
                truly viable.
