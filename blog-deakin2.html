                3 August 2020<br /><br />
                I guess most entrepreneurs must experience these kinds of
                moments - the “in-between” moments of doubt and when new ideas
                actually show up. For the past week, I learned a lot from the
                workshop and from my own research. However, after making
                different problem trees and the value proposition model, and
                also discussing ideas with my friends, I had this feeling that
                my idea is too small to address such big issues out there. Those
                big issues that I suggested myself either require a big funding
                scheme, a huge switch in policy, or influence such an
                established retail system. The more I did research, the more I
                became doubtful about my plan. That was also when Melbourne’s
                stage 4 lockdown announcement came on the news. <br /><br />

                Then, I took the weekend off for myself and did some
                self-reflection, made some video calls with my long-distance
                family members and reconnected with some old friends as their
                birthdays are coming up. That was when I realized that human
                interaction is extremely important and in turbulent situations
                like right now, all we need (however, we not all the time
                realize) is to talk to someone, keep the connection going on,
                and create new traditions with our loved ones. Traditions like
                going out for coffee, brunch or exploring new things are being
                limited right now, but it doesn’t mean we can come up with new
                ideas and have fun with each other. <br /><br />

                When reconnected with some of my friends, I also got to know
                that their businesses are in bad places right now. The products
                are not in a good selling point, and marketing must temporarily
                stop because of the low budget. <br /><br />
                That was when I decided to come up with a business idea that can
                address both issues above. An online gift box shop that you can
                use to send/exchange gift boxes with different themes for your
                friends and family. The idea is written in more detail below.

                Imagine you and your friends received the same box of goodies
                with new different brands/products (body-care, or weird snacks,
                new brands of coffee) and you can try it together and give
                feedback through those video calls. Instead of talking about how
                bad COVID is or how bored it is at home, you can now try new
                things, make jokes and laugh together. This idea, I hope, will
                bring more value to people’s lives at the moment. Personally, I
                always love receiving parcels or postcards in the mail and it
                always makes my day, I hope this will bring joy to others as
                well. <br /><br />

                The business will provide different types of curated boxes to
                meet different demands. The suppliers will be small local
                businesses that need more sales during difficult times. This can
                also benefit them in terms of increasing brand awareness in the
                community. One of the most important tasks for me at the moment
                is to find more small businesses and discuss with them about
                this idea as well as the budget and transaction process. Also, I
                must do more research on finding suppliers that provide
                eco-friendly, recycling packaging and boxes. Although this will
                be a long and solo journey, I can’t wait until everything
                unfolds.

                10/08/2020<br /><br />
                This week’s session is about Prototyping!<br /><br />
                Personally, I found this session very interesting and insightful
                because I neither have much knowledge nor experience in
                prototyping. I did draw out some UX workflow on before to
                visualize the website design and function. However, I never use
                any digital platform to demonstrate it. <br /><br />
                My business idea requires both physical and digital prototypes.
                Physical prototype involves designing packaging shape, locate
                items in boxes and decorate following different themes. Digital
                prototype involves setting up an online website for customers to
                select their cart and make purchases. This week I focused on the
                digital side! <br /><br />
                I was introduced to Marvel and MockFlow - very cool platforms
                for simple prototyping. It works like Wordpress or Squarespace,
                having all necessary elements in order for business owners to
                develop their sites and design as well as implement some UI
                techniques. Because it is simple, it doesn’t allow me to
                customize some elements.<br /><br />

                Later on, I found out about Figma. Figma is great! As I am used
                to using Photoshop and other Adobe softwares, I like the way
                Figma allows me to customize everything from scratch. I prefer
                Figma for its flexibility and for its scale system. <br /><br />
                So, after a few attempts to prototype my business on Figma last
                week, I kinda developed some better ideas to add in the big
                picture to make my products niche compared to those in the
                market. I guess when the website came into its official look and
                function, I got to see what is missing in the puzzle and also
                realize there is more work into this than I ever thought,
                especially with designing a good experience for customers when
                they are in my store digitally. <br /><br />

                This week’s session is about Business Model Canvas. This is week
                5 already!!, which means it is half way to Pitch Day and we are
                reaching the business side of our projects. <br /><br />
                The first activity was to customize our own elevator pitches.
                Elevator pitch should be short, cut to the chase, while
                showcasing the special point in the business and answer the “Why
                would anyone pay attention to our products?”. I found this task
                is necessary and important and quite easy, well, if I talk to a
                friend and tell him/her about what I do, but giving me 20
                seconds to give a stranger the whole picture of my whole
                business idea can be intimidating. My strategy was listing down
                some important keywords that would directly describe the
                products I offer, the imagery and feelings my store brings, and
                what the meaning behind all that. <br /><br />

                This is the first draft I made for an elevator pitch. I am quite
                satisfied with it and it made the 20s cut; however, it does not
                tell a story in my opinion. I want my store to have a story that
                sticks in people’s minds. Something genuine and fun, yet unique!
                <br /><br />
                So I made the second one, that includes my story in there!<br /><br />
                “If you ever watched the movie called “You’ve Got Mail”, you
                will see how interesting the way everything has changed. The
                movie was in 1993 and everyone expressed absolute happiness and
                pleasure when receiving an email. 20 years later, nobody is that
                happy receiving emails, more or less we’re glad to get rid of it
                (well, unless it’s a job offer... or a postal tracking code.. or
                some good deals you may never have time to look at), but we are
                thrilled to hear someone knock on our front door, and hand over
                a package of goodies or a postcard from oversea. The trend is
                coming back, just like how vintage takes over fashion. Gallup
                Poll said 94% of people nowadays love getting physical mail and
                finding personal letters addressed to them among all of the
                bills and junk newsletters. This is the reason I created Happy
                Goodies, to bring happiness to you, and help you reconnect with
                your loved ones!<br /><br />
                On a larger scale, Happy Goodies is created to help small
                businesses raise awareness, make sales, and stand strong during
                COVID period. We connect with many local businesses to bring the
                local goodies to your doors with customized designs and themes
                for different occasions. #supportlocalbusinesses”<br /><br />
                Well, there it is! I probably need to buy them a coffee or
                something in order for them to listen to all this (hah) but yes
                this is the feeling I want to give out. I also probably gotta
                redo another version of my pitch and throw in some niche
                elements of the business to make it stand out. <br /><br />

                Oki, moving on! <br /><br />
                Next step is to create a business model canvas that briefly
                determines elements such as key partners, key activities, key
                resources, value propositions, customer relationships, channels,
                customer segments. This feels like a business report but in a
                brief table form. <br /><br />
                Here is Happy Goodies’ business model:<br /><br />
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content__line">
            <div class="content__line_img maxContent">

              <p>
                <br /><br />
                Apart from customer segments, I also developed a business
                segment which allocates different types of customers in terms of
                their buying behaviours. I think this will help me in the
                operation process and develop proper marketing strategies for
                different segments. <br /><br />
                P/s:<br />

                This trimester I am taking 5 units of 4 different marketing
                sub-fields and I am beyond happy to gradually see them all
                connected/related with each other while building my own
                start-up/business.
