                3 August 2020<br /><br />
                I guess most entrepreneurs must experience these kinds of
                moments - the “in-between” moments of doubt and when new ideas
                actually show up. For the past week, I learned a lot from the
                workshop and from my own research. However, after making
                different problem trees and the value proposition model, and
                also discussing ideas with my friends, I had this feeling that
                my idea is too small to address such big issues out there. Those
                big issues that I suggested myself either require a big funding
                scheme, a huge switch in policy, or influence such an
                established retail system. The more I did research, the more I
                became doubtful about my plan. That was also when Melbourne’s
                stage 4 lockdown announcement came on the news. <br /><br />

                Then, I took the weekend off for myself and did some
                self-reflection, made some video calls with my long-distance
                family members and reconnected with some old friends as their
                birthdays are coming up. That was when I realized that human
                interaction is extremely important and in turbulent situations
                like right now, all we need (however, we not all the time
                realize) is to talk to someone, keep the connection going on,
                and create new traditions with our loved ones. Traditions like
                going out for coffee, brunch or exploring new things are being
                limited right now, but it doesn’t mean we can come up with new
                ideas and have fun with each other. <br /><br />

          <div class="content__line">

              <img
                class=""
                src="./media/blog media/Spark InBetween/2.jpg"
                alt=""
              />
            </div>

          <div class="content__line">
            <div class="content__line_group fullWidth">
              <p>
                <br /><br />
                When reconnected with some of my friends, I also got to know
                that their businesses are in bad places right now. The products
                are not in a good selling point, and marketing must temporarily
                stop because of the low budget. <br /><br />
                That was when I decided to come up with a business idea that can
                address both issues above. An online gift box shop that you can
                use to send/exchange gift boxes with different themes for your
                friends and family. The idea is written in more detail below.

                Imagine you and your friends received the same box of goodies
                with new different brands/products (body-care, or weird snacks,
                new brands of coffee) and you can try it together and give
                feedback through those video calls. Instead of talking about how
                bad COVID is or how bored it is at home, you can now try new
                things, make jokes and laugh together. This idea, I hope, will
                bring more value to people’s lives at the moment. Personally, I
                always love receiving parcels or postcards in the mail and it
                always makes my day, I hope this will bring joy to others as
                well. <br /><br />

                The business will provide different types of curated boxes to
                meet different demands. The suppliers will be small local
                businesses that need more sales during difficult times. This can
                also benefit them in terms of increasing brand awareness in the
                community. One of the most important tasks for me at the moment
                is to find more small businesses and discuss with them about
                this idea as well as the budget and transaction process. Also, I
                must do more research on finding suppliers that provide
                eco-friendly, recycling packaging and boxes. Although this will
                be a long and solo journey, I can’t wait until everything
                unfolds.
