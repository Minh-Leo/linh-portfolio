                31 August 2020<br /><br />
                This week is probably the one that I most expected in the whole
                program!!​<br /><br />
                I love branding. I love talking about different brands. I love
                discussing branding techniques people implement for their
                businesses. I am also currently taking Brand Management as a
                major unit so the discussions we had here really add to some
                insights I have learned recently. ​<br /><br />
                “A brand is not just a logo, a website, or your business card…
                It is an experience!” - Unknown​<br /><br />
                “Your brand is what other people say about you when you are not
                in the room” - Jeff Bezos​<br /><br />
                Just like these quotes, brand identity is one of the most
                important things when it comes to whether customers will engage
                with your products or not. The colors, the fonts, the motions,
                the messages, the website with customer experience design,
                everything adds up to the customers’ decisions.​<br /><br />
                If the branding is right, we will successfully reach our desired
                target customers, and also be capable of delivering the value
                proposition that we had promised. Jezz Bezos’ quote just
                illustrates how creating good branding is already a selling
                point, especially through the word of mouth. There are several
                levels that add up to how a person perceives a brand, which can
                be broken down to different parts in this Customer-Based Brand
                Equity (CBBE) model.​<br /><br />

          <div class="content__line">

              <img class="" src="./media/blog media/8 Branding/1.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="content__line">
            <div class="content__line_group fullWidth">
              <p>
                <br /><br />
                In order to successfully build our brand, we need to distinguish
                these elements and build an association between them to create
                consistency in our communication channels.​<br /><br />
                Regarding Happy Goodies, I want to link the brand to the true
                value propositions it delivers, that is the exciting, fun and
                happy elements in the products and service. Also this is a
                platform where some local businesses make their first online
                presence, therefore, the overall theme of brand imagery has to
                match to customers’ feelings and their expectations. This will
                also be a motivation for our customers to maintain their
                interests, and increase their intentions to purchase.​<br /><br />
                I decided to use coral-clash-pink as a background of the website
                to represent a fun and easy vibe. This color was chosen to be
                Color of the Year 2019. The Pantone Color Institute explains
                that coral color ​“embraces us with warmth and nourishment to
                provide comfort and buoyancy in our continually shifting
                environment. It also emits the desired, familiar and energizing
                aspects of color found in nature”. ​Not only the website, this
                color will also be the one I use for packagingand postcards and
                other elements in the subscription and gift boxes as a way to
                show consistency in my brand. As the color represents fun and
                trendy vibes, I hope to gain attention from millennials and
                gen-Z who are likely to be exposed to new trends and updates.
                ​<br /><br />
                The font I used for Happy Goodies is Unna - regular. This font
                is simple and easy to read, demonstrating the minimal style the
                brand is leaning towards. ​<br /><br />
                According to the prototype, the site is easy to navigate and the
                steps to order the boxes are quick with only three steps, aiming
                to bring customers a fulfilling experience before, during and
                after purchasing. Linking back to the CBBE model above, the way
                the service illustrates resonance is by engaging with the
                community through social media, and other communication
                channels. Using social media channels can maximize how the brand
                looks and feels in the eyes of customers, and also support the
                brand in terms of customer engagement and relationships.​<br /><br />
                In the workshop, we also talked and discussed the last two
                important elements of the business model, that is cost structure
                and revenue streams. Below is my decision on the cost and
                revenue in operation for now. Once launched, it is expected to
                fluctuate and depending on the situation I will update the
                status to meet demand. ​<br /><br />

                This week Isaac talked a lot about customer journey and how we
                could improve their experiences from the first time they see
                your brand till the moment they actually take action. The
                concept can be illustrated through the AIDA model, which stands
                for Awareness, Interest, Decision, and Intention (Sales). There
                are many many ways to help this process go smoother and that
                includes creating a map that demonstrates specific stages that
                customers experience in their purchasing process. There are the
                5 E’s that we should look into to understand customers' needs,
                how they make decisions and how satisfied they are with the
                journey. ​<br /><br />

                Entice -​ How will our future customers first hear about us?
                What will trigger their interest?​<br /><br />
                This indicates the level of coverage the brand is towards its
                customers. For Happy Goodies, the coverage will be fully online
                through social media, website, search engine and also through
                direct marketing such as word of mouth. The reason I develop
                both subscription boxes and gift boxes at the same time is
                because gift boxes tend to reach more people than subscription
                boxes. Imagine! You know about Happy Goodies because you had
                subscribed to our boxes before, then it's almost Christmas time
                and you think about buying a gift for a friend, you will then
                can choose and customize your box on the same platform you’ve
                been familiar with, how convenient! When your friends receive
                the gifts, they will now be aware of Happy Goodies. I also plan
                to implement a “Coming Soon” campaign around 1 month before
                launching to spread the news and increase potential customers’
                curiosity. ​<br /><br />Enter - ​What impression do we create
                for new customers when they walk into your
                shop/office/website?​<br /><br />
                The website is easy to navigate and the steps to order are quick
                which only goes through 3 simple steps. The new arrival items
                will be in headline and lead customers through the purchasing
                process just like any e-commerce store, however add a little bit
                more of authenticity and friendly vibes to the slogans or brand
                mantra. The impression I want to create for the customers is
                fun, easy and simple, with a mission to help local businesses
                maintain their status.

                Engage ​- Will customers make a quick purchase? Or should we
                build long-term customer relationships? How long do they stay on
                the website? Human-interaction or entirely automated?​<br /><br />I
                want to build more creative ideas for the boxes, which point
                towards a specific group of customers e.g. gift for the
                introverts/ extroverts, gift for the sudden gratitude, gift for
                no reason, anime lover, etc. These ideas itself are unique and
                will attract more people coming to the store. I don’t aim to use
                much discount promotion as the store is already built with
                cost-driven structure. This process is entirely automated as
                other e-commerce stores, with a touch of personal interaction as
                the website should be set up to have a pop-up chat box when
                someone needs it. <br /><br />
                Exit - ​What is our customers’ last impression?​<br /><br />
                After the purchase, Happy Goodies will send customers
                confirmation emails with a link to track their parcels. It will
                also include a thank you card with customized notes to
                personalize customers’ experience.​<br /><br />
                Extend - ​What triggers a repeat purchase? Do our customers ever
                come back, or tell their friends about us?​<br /><br />
                We will follow-up after 1 week of customers receiving the
                package, and check if they feel satisfied with the products.
                Existing customers have opportunities to customize or build
                their own boxes through an interactive game on the website. ​<br /><br />

                Seriously I always had this thought that Demo Day is “someday in
                the future”, and then today Isaac said “Let’s talk about
                Pitching because Demo Day is in 2 weeks!”, and my heart just
                skipped a beat for that…​<br /><br />
                Anyways…​<br /><br />
                After lowkey whining about how soon it is going to be (in my
                head of course!), I started to freak out a little thinking about
                how much information, plans, and many twists and turns we had in
                the process of creating our first start-up idea. It was quite
                hard to imagine we can include everything in such short 5
                minutes. I have had many presentations before, but usually takes
                15 minutes and about a well-researched topic, not a whole
                business idea I built from scratch like 2 months ago.​<br /><br />

                However, listening to Isaac talk about the pitch canvas and how
                to gather the information together, organize it, and translate
                it in the way other people can understand in a short time frame
                was really helpful and insightful. The canvas suggests that we
                should follow a particular topic order to make sense of our
                ideas. The order looks like this:​<br /><br />1. Simple
                Statement​<br />
                2. The Pain/The Gain​<br />
                3. Product​<br />
                4. Product Demo​<br />
                5. What’s Unique​<br />
                6. Customer Traction​<br />
                7. Business Model​<br />
                8. Investment​<br />
                9. Team​<br />
                10. Statement/Call To Action​<br />
                11. Why You?​<br />
                As all other presentations, the opening and closure are the most
                two important things deciding whether the audience will listen
                to our ideas and act on the information we deliver. I decided to
                start with a problem statement, which hopefully can catch the
                audience's attention. Something like:​<br /><br />
                “Hi bla-bla-bla, my name is bla-bla-bla. I’m here today to talk
                about Happy Goodies - a subscription & gift box service that
                brings local goodies to customers & helps local businesses make
                sales in COVID-19.”​<br /><br />
                Short and sweet, the next one is extending and explaining the
                problem so that the audience can feel the pain that the
                community has to endure at the moment. Then, it is now a good
                time for the product introduction to enter to show the power and
                the improvement it brings to people’s lives. Next, I will dig
                deeper into how the product will work, what the target customers
                and potential partners are, how the prototype works. Then,
                introduce the business model, a general view of market
                competition, how we can differentiate ourselves from others, how
                much we need for investment and BOOM! That’s that PITCH! Easy
                peasy!​<br /><br />

                Oh, something is wrong here, maybe it will be that quick and
                easy in a perfect world, or if I’m born with a pitching super
                power, but nope…*cry a little​<br /><br />
                The process of getting this pitch flowing on the right path is a
                result of 2 whole weeks continuously drafting, reading, present
                mock-up, getting feedback, fixing, editing, present again,
                drafting here and there, again and again and again, until the
                speech is smooth, the time is met, and my multi-tasking skill is
                actually my super power now because of all the timing, speaking,
                moving my Prezi at the same time. ​<br /><br />
                Following practice presenting for Isaac and Eleanor, here are
                some of the feedback I received for my 1st and 2nd drafts:​<br /><br />
                ● The colors used in the presentation should match with the
                colors of the brand​<br />
                ● Ease out on the stats, ease in a bit more storytelling​<br />
                ● Use diagram to explain business ideas (business cycles)​<br />
                ● Never repeat what is in the slide, make use of all space and
                time​<br />
                ● Show more of my thinking process and reasoning for my
                decisions​<br />
                ● Value proposition should be separated for the end-customers
                and the business partners​<br />
                ● Real-life examples​<br />
                ● Mention tiny bit about how the business make money​<br />This
                feedback was exactly what I needed to improve my presentation.
                It is better for me to go straight to the points and lose all
                the unimportant information.​<br /><br />

                2 October 2020​<br /><br />
                Today is the Pitch Practice with all the teams and individuals.
                ​<br /><br />
                This is an opportunity to present in front of all members of the
                program (virtual of course!) and gain feedback from them.​<br /><br />
                After I presented my second last draft, I received some useful
                feedback from my peers. The key points were about how I should
                lose some of the moving elements in my powerpoint, because it
                may distract the audience to actually listen to what I have to
                say. I was honestly grateful that they gave me the comment
                because it means I could lose some multi-tasks during the pitch
                and concentrate on my content more.​<br /><br />
                Apart from that, the ideas and the information I gave in the
                pitch was fulfilling and understandable which was thought to be
                successful if I ever launched. I was really touched hearing that
                from them and that was my motivation practicing more and more
                before pitch day comes on next Monday. ​<br /><br />
